    "article: It’s a question asked on Reddit and Twitter every day. It makes the shoulders of online marketers tense up and makes analysts frown with concern. You look at your analytics, eyes wide, and find yourself asking; “Why do I have such a high bounce rate?” What Is a Bounce Rate? As a refresher, Google refers to a “bounce” as “a single-page session on your site.” Bounce rate refers to the percentage of visitors that leave your website (or “bounce” back to the search results or referring website) after viewing only one page on your site. This can even happen when a user idles on a page for more than 30 minutes. So what is a high bounce rate, and why is it bad? Well “high bounce rate” is a relative term, which depends on what your company’s goals are, and what kind of site you have. Low bounce rates – or too low bounce rates – can be problems too. Most websites will see bounce rates between 26% to 70%, according to a RocketFuel study. 13 Reasons Your Website Can Have a High Bounce Rate Based on the data they gathered, they provided a bounce rate grading system of sorts: ADVERTISEMENT CONTINUE READING BELOW 25% or lower: Something is probably broken 26-40%: Excellent 41-55%: Average 56-70%: Higher than normal, but could make sense depending on the website 70% or higher: Bad and/or something is probably broken The overall bounce rate for your site will live in the Audience Overview tab of Google Analytics. 13 Reasons Your Website Can Have a High Bounce Rate You can find your bounce rate for individual channels and pages in the behavior column of most views in Google Analytics. 13 Reasons Your Website Can Have a High Bounce Rate What follows are 13 common reasons your website can have a high bounce rate and how to fix these issues. 1. Slow-to-Load Page Google has a renewed focus on site speed, especially as a part of the Core Web Vitals initiative. ADVERTISEMENT CONTINUE READING BELOW A slow-to-load page can be a huge problem for bounce rate. Site speed is part of Google’s ranking algorithm. Google wants to promote content that provides a positive experience for users, and they recognize that a slow site can provide a poor experience. Users want the facts fast – this is part of the reason Google has put so much work into featured snippets. If your page takes longer than a few seconds to load, your visitors may get fed up and leave. Fixing site speed is a lifelong journey for most SEO and marketing pros. But the upside is that with each incremental fix, you should see an incremental boost in speed. Review your page speed (overall and for individual pages) using tools like: Google PageSpeed Insights. The Google Search Console PageSpeed reports. Lighthouse reports. Pingdom. GTmetrix. They’ll offer you recommendations specific to your site, such as compressing your images, reducing third-party scripts, and leveraging browser caching. Take the frustration out of finishing projects.

Self-Sufficient Content Sometimes your content is efficient enough people can quickly get what they need and bounce! This can be a wonderful thing. Perhaps you’ve achieved the content marketer’s dream and created awesome content that wholly consumed them for a handful of minutes in their lives. Or perhaps you have a landing page that only requires the user to complete a short lead form. To determine whether bounce rate is nothing to worry about, you’ll want to look at the Time Spent on Page and Average Session Duration metrics in Google Analytics. You can also conduct user experience testing and A/B testing to see if the high bounce rate is a problem. If the user is spending a couple of minutes or more on the page, that sends a positive signal to Google that they found your page highly relevant to their search query. If you want to rank for that particular search query, that kind of user intent is gold. ADVERTISEMENT CONTINUE READING BELOW If the user is spending less than a minute on the page (which may be the case of a properly optimized landing page with a quick-hit CTA form), consider enticing the reader to read some of your related blog posts after filling out the form. 3. Disproportional Contribution by a Few Pages If we expand on the example from the previous section, you may have a few pages on your site that are contributing disproportionally to the overall bounce rate for your site. Google is savvy at recognizing the difference between these. If your single CTA landing pages reasonably satisfy user intent and cause them to bounce quickly after taking an action, but your longer-form content pages have a lower bounce rate, you’re probably good to go. However, you will want to dig in and confirm that this is the case or discover if some of these pages with a higher bounce rate shouldn’t be causing users to leave en masse. ADVERTISEMENT CONTINUE READING BELOW Open up Google Analytics, go to Behavior > Site Content > Landing Pages, and sort by Bounce Rate. Consider adding an advanced filter to remove pages that might skew the results. For example, it’s not necessarily helpful to agonize over the one Twitter share with five visits that have all your social UTM parameters tacked onto the end of the URL. My rule of thumb is to determine a minimum threshold of volume that is significant for the page. Choose what makes sense for your site, whether it’s 100 visits or 1,000 visits, then click on Advanced and filter for Sessions greater than that. 13 Reasons Your Website Can Have a High Bounce Rate 4. Misleading Title Tag and/or Meta Description Ask yourself: Is the content of your page accurately summarized by your title tag and meta description? ADVERTISEMENT CONTINUE READING BELOW If not, visitors may enter your site thinking your content is about one thing, only to find that it isn’t, and then bounce back to whence they came. Whether it was an innocent mistake or you were trying to game the system by optimizing for keyword clickbait (shame on you!), this is, fortunately, simple enough to fix. Either review the content of your page and adjust the title tag and meta description accordingly or rewrite the content to address the search queries you want to attract visitors for. You can also check what kind of meta description Google has generated for your page for common searches – Google can change your meta description, and if they make it worse, you can take steps to remedy that. 5. Blank Page or Technical Error If your bounce rate is exceptionally high and you see that people are spending less than a few seconds on the page, it’s likely your page is blank, returning a 404, or otherwise not loading properly. ADVERTISEMENT CONTINUE READING BELOW Take a look at the page from your audience’s most popular browser and device configurations (e.g., Safari on desktop and mobile, Chrome on mobile, etc.) to replicate their experience. You can also check in Search Console under Coverage to discover the issue from Google’s perspective. Correct the issue yourself or talk to someone who can – an issue like this can cause Google to drop your page from the search results in a hurry. 13 Reasons Your Website Can Have a High Bounce Rate 6. Bad Link from Another Website You could be doing everything perfect on your end to achieve a normal or low bounce rate from organic search results, and still have a high bounce rate from your referral traffic. ADVERTISEMENT CONTINUE READING BELOW The referring site could be sending you unqualified visitors or the anchor text and context for the link could be misleading. Sometimes this is a result of sloppy copywriting. The writer or publisher linked to your site in the wrong part of the copy or didn’t mean to link to your site at all. Reach out to the author of the article, then the editor or webmaster if the author can’t update the article post-publish. Politely ask them to remove the link to your site – or update the context, whichever makes sense. (Tip: You can easily find their contact information with this guide.) Unfortunately, the referring website may be trying to sabotage you with some negative SEO tactics, out of spite, or just for fun. For example, they may have linked to your Guide to Adopting a Puppy with the anchor text of FREE GET RICH QUICK SCHEME. In these instances, you’re doing the job right if the page has a higher bounce rate.\n
